📖✍️ English for Tourism – Reading and Writing Skills
For SMK Pariwisata Students

What is this section about?
In the tourism world, you need to understand many written things like brochures, reviews, emails, and travel plans. You also need to write clearly—for example, when replying to a guest, writing a tour plan, or creating an attractive travel ad.

This part of the course will help you become more confident in reading and writing in English. You’ll learn how to read important info, understand meaning and tone, and write professional and polite texts.

The tasks are based on real situations in tourism. You’ll also get practice to think more deeply through HOTS tasks (Higher Order Thinking Skills), like giving suggestions, solving problems, or improving a text.

Let’s get started with 5 fun and useful units that match your future job in the tourism industry!
